- See [[product measure]] for aggregated statements and usage.
- [[theorem]] (Fubini, recall)
  - If $f$ is [[absolute integrability|absolutely integrable]] on $(\Omega_1\times\Omega_2,\mathcal{F}_1\otimes\mathcal{F}_2)$, then iterated integrals exist and are equal to the product integral; order can be interchanged.
