- #[[measure theory]]
- Given two [[sigma-finite]] [[measure space]]s, there exists a **unique** [[product measure]] $\mu_1 \otimes \mu_2$ on $\sigma(\mathcal{F}_1 \times \mathcal{F}_2)$ , such that for any $A_1 \in \mathcal{F}_1, A_2 \in \mathcal{F}_2$ with finite measure, one has:
  $$\mu_1 \otimes \mu_2(A_1 \times A_2) = \mu_1(A_1) \cdot \mu_2(A_2)$$
- [[aggregation]]
	- [[Cavalieri principle]] (indicator/nonnegative): iterated integrals equal without integrability.
	- [[Tonelli's theorem]] (nonnegative): iterated integrals/product integral coincide, possibly $+\infty$.
	- [[Fubini's theorem]] (integrable): change order of integration; absolute integrability required.
	  - see [[absolute integrability]].
	- Construction: pre-measure on rectangles/cylinders, uniqueness by $\pi$â€“$\lambda$ on generators, extension via [[Caratheodory extension theorem]].
	- For countably many factors: see [[countable product of probability spaces]] and [[cylinder set]].
