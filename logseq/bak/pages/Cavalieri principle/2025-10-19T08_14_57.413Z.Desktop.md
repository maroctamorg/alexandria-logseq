- #[[measure theory]]
- Given [[sigma-finite]] [[measure space]]s, $E \in \sigma(\mathcal{F}_1 \otimes \mathcal{F}_2)$, then:
	- $\forall \omega \in \Omega_1, E_\omega := \{\omega' \in \Omega_2 : (\omega, \omega') \in E\}$ is [[measurable]]
	- $f_E : \omega_1 \to \R := \omega \to \mu_2(E_\omega)$ is $\mathcal{F}_1$-to-$\mathcal{B}(\R)$ [[measurable]] and
	  $$\mu_1 \otimes \mu_2(E) = \int_{\Omega_1} f_E d\mu_1$$
- this extends to the [[(measure-)completion]] with respect to the [[product measure]] as well - with the caveat that the function is defined only almost everywhere, and the sets measureable
