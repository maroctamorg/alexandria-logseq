- [[theorem]] (SLLN)
  - If $X_i$ are i.i.d. with $\mathbb{E}|X_1|<\infty$, then $\bar{X}_n\to \mathbb{E}X_1$ almost surely.
- [[notes]]
  - In the lecture: finite variance version first; full version via martingales later. [[Borel-Cantelli lemma]] is a key tool.
- [[hint]]
  - Truncation + Borelâ€“Cantelli on large deviations of partial sums; or apply martingale methods (outside scope here).
