- [[definition]]
  - $(X_n)$ is tight if $\forall\varepsilon>0\ \exists M:\ \sup_n\mathbb{P}(|X_n|>M)<\varepsilon$.
- [[usage]]
  - Pre-compactness of laws on $\mathbb{R}$: every tight sequence has a weakly convergent subsequence ([[Helly's selection theorem]]).
- [[note]]
  - Tightness + pointwise [[characteristic function]] convergence often implies distributional convergence.
