- [[theorem]] (Fourier inversion)
  - If $X$ has an integrable, sufficiently smooth density $f$, then for a.e. $x$,
    $f(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{\mathbb{R}} e^{-itx}\,\varphi_X(t)\,dt$.
- [[notes]]
  - Use smooth approximations and [[Riemannâ€“Lebesgue lemma]]; justify exchanging integrals/limits via dominated convergence.
- [[tips]]
  - For [[probability distribution function]] recovery, integrate test functions and pass to limits; careful with boundary terms.
