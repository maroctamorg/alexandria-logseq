- [[definition]]
	- A collection $\mathcal{A} \subset 2^\Omega$ is called a [[lambda-system]] if
		- $\Omega \in \mathcal{A}$
		- $A, B \in \mathcal{A} \land A \subset B \implies B \setminus A \in \mathcal{A}$
		- $A_i \in \mathcal{A}, A_1 \subset A_2 \subset .. \implies \bigcup_i A_i \in \mathcal{A}$
- [[remarks]]
	- under the first two conditions, the third is equivalent to closedness over disjoint unions
	- the differentiating factor between a [[lambda-system]] and a [[sigma-algebra]] is that a [[sigma-algebra]] is closed under arbitrary unions, while [[lambda]] is exclusive to disjoint sets
	- the 3rd condition is analogous to [[lower continuity]] in a [[measure space]] but looser (more generic) as it can be used to prove the third point in the definition of a [[sigma-algebra]] in combination with finite union/intersection
- [[lemma]]
	- based on the above, a [[lambda-system]] that is closed under finite unions or intersections is a [[sigma-algebra]], or otherwise expressed:
		- If $\mathcal{A}$ is both a [[pi-system]] and a [[lambda-system]], then it is a [[sigma-algebra]]
