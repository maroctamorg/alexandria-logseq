- [[definition]]
	- Let $M$ be a [[differentiable manifold]] and $A \subset M$.
	  A mapping $X : A \to TM : p \to X(p) := X_p \in T_pM, \forall p \in M$ is called a [[vector field]] in $A$.
	- We denote $\mathcal{T}(A)$, the set of all [[smooth vector field]]s in $A$, and note that this is clearly a real [[vector space]] of [[smooth (manifold) mapping]]s where addition and scalar multiplication (scalar-valued functions) are defined pointwise.
