- [[definition]]
	- Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional (real) [[vector space]].
	  A [[linear map]] $\omega : V \to \R$ is called a [[covector]] (or [[dual]]) on $V$ and the [[vector space]] of all [[covectors]] (on $V$) is called [[dual space]] of $V$ and denoted by $V^*$.
- [[notation]]
	- $\langle w, v \rangle = \langle v, w \rangle = \omega(v) \in \R, \omega \in V^*, v \in V$
- [[lemma]]
	- Let $V$ be an n-dimensional [[vector space]] with [[basis]] $(v_i)$.
	  Then [[covector]]s $(\omega^i)$, with
	  $$\omega^j(v_i) = \delta^j_i$$
	  form a [[basis]] of $V^*$.
		- In particular, $\text{dim}V^* = \text{dim}V$.
