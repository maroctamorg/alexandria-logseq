- A map $f : \Omega_1 \to \Omega_2$ between two [[measurable space]]s is said to be **[[measurable]]** iff the preimage of any measurable set is measurable, i.e.
  $$\mathcal{F}_2 \subset \mathcal{F}_1 \circ f^{-1}$$
	- where $\mathcal{F}_1 \circ f^{-1} := \{A \in 2^{\Omega_2} : f^{-1}(A) \in \mathcal{F}_1\}$
