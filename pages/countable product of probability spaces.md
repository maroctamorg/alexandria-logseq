- [[definition]]
  - Given $(\Omega_i,\mathcal{F}_i,\mathbb{P}_i)$ $\sigma$-finite (here probability), the countable product is $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$ with
    - $\Omega=\prod_{i\ge1}\Omega_i$,
    - $\mathcal{F}$ the $\sigma$-algebra generated by [[cylinder set]]s,
    - $\mathbb{P}$ the unique measure with $\mathbb{P}(\prod_{i\le N}A_i\times \prod_{i>N}\Omega_i)=\prod_{i\le N}\mathbb{P}_i(A_i)$.
- [[theorem]] (up to 1.8.3)
  - Existence/uniqueness of $\mathbb{P}$ on the product: define a pre-measure on the cylinder semi-ring by
    $\mu(\prod_{i\le N}A_i\times \prod_{i>N}\Omega_i):=\prod_{i\le N}\mathbb{P}_i(A_i)$, check finite additivity and upper continuity on decreasing cylinder sets, then extend via [[Caratheodory extension theorem]]; uniqueness via agreement on a generating $\pi$-system and [[Dynkin's theorem]].
- [[hints]]
  - $\sigma$-finiteness ensures sections are measurable a.e. and extension is well-defined.
  - Cylinders form both a semi-ring and a $\pi$-system; once measures agree there, they agree on $\sigma(\text{cylinders})$.
