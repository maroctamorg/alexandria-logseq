- #[[measure theory]]
- Given two [[sigma-finite]] [[measure space]]s, there exists a **unique** [[product measure]] $\mu_1 \otimes \mu_2$ on $\sigma(\mathcal{F}_1 \times \mathcal{F}_2)$ , such that for any $A_1 \in \mathcal{F}_1, A_2 \in \mathcal{F}_2$ with finite measure, one has:
  $$\mu_1 \otimes \mu_2(A_1 \times A_2) = \mu_1(A_1) \cdot \mu_2(A_2)$$
- [[summary]] (see linked pages for full statements)
	- [[Cavalieri principle]]: sets/nonnegative functions; measure by slices; iterated integrals equal.
	- [[Tonelli's theorem]]: $f\ge0$; iterated integrals = product integral (possibly $+\infty$).
	- [[Fubini's theorem]]: $f\in L^1(\mu_1\otimes\mu_2)$; swap order; integrals equal (requires [[absolute integrability]]).
	- Construction: pre-measure on rectangles/cylinders; extend via [[Caratheodory extension theorem]]; uniqueness by $\pi$â€“$\lambda$.
	- Countable products: [[countable product of probability spaces]], with [[cylinder set]] generators.
