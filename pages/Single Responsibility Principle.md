- #SOLID
- The **single-responsibility principle** (SRP) states that there should never be more than one reason for a class to change. In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.
- Importance:
	- [[Maintainability]]: When classes have a single, well-defined responsibility, they're easier to understand and modify.
	- [[Testability]]: It's easier to write unit tests for classes with a single focus.
	- [[Flexibility]]: Changes to one responsibility don't affect unrelated parts of the system.
- If this principle is followed, it leads to a design where the main responsibility of the class is completely encapsulated inside the class, and the services provided by the class through its interface are strictly limited to the responsibility. Then, the only reason to change the class would be that its responsibility needs to be changed.
