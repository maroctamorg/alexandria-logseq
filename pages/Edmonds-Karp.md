- [[problem]]
	- [[maximum flow]]
- [[idea]]
	- choose the shortest s-t path in the [[residual network]] as the [[augmenting path]]
	- otherwise identical to [[Ford-Fulkerson]]
- [[proof]]
	- [[lemma]]
		- The shortest path $\delta_f(s, v)$ increases [[monotonically]] with each [[flow augmentation]].
- [[analysis]]
	- $O(|V||E|^2)$ running time
- [[remarks]]
	- simple shortest path solution (without cost)
