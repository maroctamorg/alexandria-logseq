- The [[extrinsic curvature]] at a point $p$ of a 2-dimensional surface embedded in $\R^3$ can be defined in terms of two numbers $\kappa_1 \kappa_2$ called [[principal curvatures]].
	- These are obtained by computing the 2nd derivate of curves generated by intersecting planes $P$ through $p$. The maximum and minimum signed curvatures obtained by this process are the principal curvatures of the surface.
	- Principal curvatures are not [[isometrically invariant]] (i.e. they change under isometric transformations) - so they are not [[intrisic]] properties of the surface.
- [[theorems]]
	- [[Gaussâ€™s Theorema Egregium]] For any embedded surface $S \subset \R^3$, the product $K = \kappa_1 \kappa_2$ is [[intrinsic]]: i.e. $K$ does not change if one bends the surface without stretching it. This product $K$ is called the **Gaussian curvature** of the surface $S$
