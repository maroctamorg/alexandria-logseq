- [[proposition]] (Abstract change of variables)
  - If $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$ and measurable $X:\Omega\to\Omega'$, and $g$ integrable on $\Omega'$, then
    $\mathbb{E}[g(X)]=\int g\,d\mu_X$, where $\mu_X$ is the law of $X$.

  - Used throughout to pass expectations under measurable maps; pairs with product measure and independence arguments.
