- The **dependency inversion principle** (DIP) states to depend upon abstractions, not concretes.
- Importance:
	- [[Loose coupling]]: Reduces dependencies between modules, making the code more flexible and easier to test.
	- [[Flexibility]]: Enables changes to implementations without affecting clients.
	- [[Maintainability]]: Makes code easier to understand and modify.
