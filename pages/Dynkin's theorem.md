- [[theorem]]
	- Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a [[pi-system]] and $\Lambda$ be a [[lambda-system]]. Then
	  $$\mathcal{A} \subset \Lambda \implies \sigma(\mathcal{A}) \subset \Lambda$$
- [[corollaries]]
	- if two measures $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ on a [[sigma-algebra]] $\mathcal{F}$ are such that $\mu_1(\Omega)$ = $\mu_2(\Omega) < \infty$ and that they agree on a [[pi-system]] $\mathcal{A}$, they agree also on $\sigma(\mathcal{A})$
	- A [[probability measure]] on $(\R, \mathcal{B}(\R))$ is [[uniquely determined]] by its [[probability distribution function]] $F_\mathbb{P}(t) := \mathbb{P}((-\infty, t])$
