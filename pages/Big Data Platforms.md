- [[Dark Transistors]]
	- Dark silicon is the part of a computer chip that must be kept turned off because powering everything at once would create too much heat and waste too much energy. This problem began when transistors kept shrinking, but the voltage they need stopped shrinking at the same rate. As a result, chips gained more and more transistors, but not all of them could be used at the same time. In modern chips, a large percentage of the silicon has to stay “dark.”
	- This became a serious issue when the industry shifted to multicore processors. Adding more cores should have made chips much faster, but in practice, many cores can’t run together because of power limits. This means the speed benefits flatten out, and simply adding transistors no longer guarantees performance growth.
	- To solve this, chip designers use smarter strategies. One is **specialization**, where special-purpose units (like AI or video accelerators) are built into chips. These can do certain tasks much more efficiently than general-purpose cores. Another is **near-threshold computing**, where chips are run at very low voltage to save energy, while still keeping them reliable with extra design tricks. A third is **approximate computing**, which saves energy by allowing “good enough” answers for tasks like graphics or machine learning. Along with techniques like power-gating and smart scheduling, these methods make sure the active parts of a chip give maximum useful performance, even if the whole chip can’t be on at once.
