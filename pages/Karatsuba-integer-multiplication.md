- [[idea]]
	- we treat numbers in their binary representation (e.g. 2 n-bit numbers)
	- multiply the first/last $\lceil n/2 \rceil$ binary digits with each other
	- similar approach as [[Strassen-matrix-multiplication]]
		- replace one recursive call (expensive, in this case multiplication), for more intermediate calculations/values (in this case additions)
		- for large values this will pay off
	- [[running time]]: $O(n^{\log 3})$
