- [[theorem]]
	- Let $\mathcal{R}$ be a [[semi-ring]] on a set $\Omega$, and $\mu : \mathcal{R} \to \R_{\ge 0}$ a [[pre-measure]].
	  Then there exists a [[measure]] on $\sigma(\mathcal{R})$ that coincides with $\mu$ on $\mathcal{R}$.
- [[remarks]]
	- the idea is that the [[finitely additive]] property of a [[pre-measure]] can be extended to [[countable additivity]] by extending it to a [[sigma-algebra]]
	- the proof goes by defining an [[outer measure]] function on a set of [[well splitting]] subsets and demonstrating that it agrees with the [[pre-measure]] on $\mathcal{R}$, and that the set is a [[sigma-algebra]] containing $\mathcal{R}$
- [[corollaries]]
	- If $\Omega$ can be written as a countable union of sets in $\mathcal{R}$, then the extension of $\mu$ to $\sigma(\mathcal{R})$ is unique.
