- [[definition]]
	- $\mu : \mathcal{R} \to \R_{\ge 0}$ is a **pre-measure** on [[semi-ring]] $\mathcal{R}$ iff
		- $\mu(\empty) = 0$
		- $\mu$ is [[finitely additive]] on $\mathcal{R}$
		- $A = \bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i$ with $A, A_i \in \mathcal{R}$, we have $\mu(A) \le \sum_{i=1}^\infty \mu(A_i)$
- [[remarks]]
	- the conditions are the *same as for a [[measure]] but we reserve the term for functions on a [[sigma-algebra]]
		- notable difference is that the additivity is restricted to finite unions
