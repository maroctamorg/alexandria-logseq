- components
	- RAM
	- processor running a constant size program, with constant time memory cell access
	- ***word*** ram
		- constant time logical and arithmetic operations on words of size ***w*** bits
		- where $w=\theta(\log n)$, where $n$ is input length
		- this allows constant-time pointers approximation
			- **note** - except for large number problems
