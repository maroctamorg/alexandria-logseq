- This is my [[logseq]] graph implementation of a [[zettelkasten]]/[[second brain]].
  The [[journal]] is the entrypoint for the notes. Concepts are abstracted away into their own pages and connections are made between concepts rather than via the journal page.
  As the graph grows I expect to see the abstract nodes quickly outgrow specific nodes, at the same time the journal nodes (when included in the graph) would perhaps form a skeleton when similar thoughts carry over day-to-day.
